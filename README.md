gobot
=====

a chat bot written in GO for automating jenkins builds and testing via github. concept based on Github's hubot and janky scripts, it is designed to be extensible via easy to develop plugins.

because it is written in GO it can be deployed just about anywhere with ease, unlike Github's janky which was hours of hair pulling for a non-ruby hacker for those un-familiar with GO it is a compiled language like C but has speed of development like python.
